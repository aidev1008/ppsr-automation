}
```

#### GET /

Health check endpoint.

**Response:**

}
```

### Example Usage

**Using curl:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/open_ppsr" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "username": "your_username",
       "password": "your_password",
       "vin_number": "1HGCM82633A123456"
     }'
```

**Using Python requests:**
```python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/open_ppsr",
    json={
        "username": "your_username",
        "password": "your_password",
        "vin_number": "1HGCM82633A123456"
    }
)

result = response.json()
print(f"Plate Number: {result['plateNumber']}")
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default | Options |
|----------|-------------|---------|---------|
| `HEADLESS` | Run browser in headless mode | `true` | `true`, `false` |

### Automation Settings

The following settings can be adjusted in `ppsr.py`:

- `SLOW_MO_MS`: Delay between Playwright actions (default: 1500ms)
- `WAIT_AFTER_ACTION_MS`: Base wait time between major steps (default: 2400ms)
- Human typing delays: 120-220ms per character

## Logging and Debugging

### Log Files

- **Location**: `./logs/`
- **Format**: Daily rotating logs with 7-day retention
- **Content**: Detailed execution logs with timestamps and request IDs

### Screenshots

Automatic screenshots are captured at key stages:
- Initial page load
- After login
- After menu navigation
- After VIN entry
- Search results
- Error states

### Playwright Traces

Complete execution traces are saved for each request:
- **Location**: `./logs/{request_id}/trace-{request_id}.zip`
- **Usage**: Open with `playwright show-trace trace-file.zip`

## Development

### Project Structure

```
ppsr-automation/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ppsr.py              # Main application file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirement.txt      # Python dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md           # Project documentation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env                # Environment configuration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ logs/               # Generated logs and traces
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {request_id}/   # Per-request artifacts
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ *.png       # Screenshots
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ trace-*.zip # Playwright traces
```

### Testing

Run the development server with auto-reload:
```bash
uvicorn ppsr:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Debugging

1. Set `HEADLESS=false` in `.env` to see browser actions
2. Check logs in `./logs/ppsr.log`
3. Review screenshots in request-specific log directories
4. Analyze Playwright traces with `playwright show-trace`

## Security Considerations

- üîí Credentials are not logged or stored
- üõ°Ô∏è Each request runs in an isolated browser context
- üîê Environment variables for sensitive configuration
- üìù Request tracking with unique IDs for audit trails

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Browser Launch Failures:**
- Ensure Playwright browsers are installed: `playwright install chromium`
- Check system requirements for Chromium

**Login Failures:**
- Verify PPSR credentials
- Check if PPSR site structure has changed
- Review screenshots in logs directory

**VIN Search Issues:**
- Ensure VIN format is correct (17 characters)
- Check if declaration checkbox is being ticked
- Review Playwright trace for detailed execution flow

**Network Issues:**
- Check internet connectivity
- Verify PPSR site accessibility
- Review request failure logs

### Support

For issues and questions:
1. Check the logs directory for detailed error information
2. Review Playwright traces for execution details
3. Create an issue with relevant log excerpts and error messages
